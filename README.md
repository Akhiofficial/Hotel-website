# Hotel-website
A static hotel website built using HTML and CSS, focused solely on the frontend. This project highlights a clean and responsive design, with sections for services, room types, pricing, and contact information. As a purely frontend project, it demonstrates how to structure and style a professional-looking website without backend functionality.
